Brownian motion poses unique challenges to classical calculus, revealing the limitations of traditional methods when dealing with stochastic processes. To illustrate this, let’s consider a seemingly simple stochastic differential equation:

$$dx = B(t) dB(t)$$

where $$B(t)$$ is a Brownian process. At first glance, it seems reasonable to expect that the solution satisfies $$\mathbb{E}[x(t)] = 0$$. Let’s investigate by solving this equation. Assuming an initial condition $$x(0) = 0$$, we integrate both sides from $$0$$ to $$t$$:

$$\int_0^t dx = \int_0^t B(s) dB(s)$$

This suggests:

$$x(t) = \frac{B(t)^2}{2}.$$

At first, this seems plausible. However, computing the expected value of $$x(t)$$ reveals something surprising. Using the fact that $$\mathbb{E}[B(t)^2] = t$$, we find:

$$\mathbb{E}[x(t)] = \frac{\mathbb{E}[B(t)^2]}{2} = \frac{t}{2} \neq 0.$$

This result contradicts our initial intuition. What’s going wrong? The issue lies in the fact that classical calculus cannot handle stochastic processes like Brownian motion. While Brownian motion is continuous, it is nowhere differentiable, making expressions like $$B(s)dB(s)$$ ill-defined in the ordinary sense. To rigorously deal with such integrals, we must turn to the framework of Itô calculus.
